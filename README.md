Hi People!
Jay here, otherwise known as YugHug. I'm a FreeCodeCamper, who hasn't found a favorite language yet. I fell in love with code, through a serious of unfortunate events, and I'm yet another person not using the degree that I paid for :) 
Avocados are the best fruit. 
Fun fact: I'm learning french and danish. Why? I'll tell you in about 5 years. 
Fun fact: Never invite me for subpar food. I'll eat it, of course, but...what was I saying?
